# Challenge
-------
Hello, and welcome to my challenges! This is a silly little game to get the combo to 2 physical locks on a box! Both of the challenges are hard for people who do not have massive amounts of experience in the challenge's respective area. Both have some steps listed below, But some notes for both of them:
1. AI and Google is allowed, this is stupid code stuff, so this is not cheating.
2. Help from others is allowed, if you know someone really good at that stuff, you can just ask them for help.
3. Looking at the code is the intended way, you can deviate from that. Build a new program to check every variable by outputting it, build an interpretter, build an entire extra challenge on top, I don't care, but you may not manipulate the code in any way on the source file, you may look, but no touchy
4. Have fun, if you get frustrated, please shut off your computer and go do something more fun and come back to this later. This is some bullcrap that may not be fun all the time, so feel free to just leave.

## BF challenge
-------
The crux of this challenge is as follows: What am I reading, what is it doing, and why it is only 8 characters? This esoteric programming language is known to be stupidly difficult, unreadable, and very limiting. You must use main.bf and cc.bf to complete this, broken.bf is a failed attempt at making cc.bf shorter. You will get 2 codes from this, but only one is used, oh, and, by the way, it's only 3 digits of one of those codes. But, all the numbers are in sequence in the code. I do have the interpretter I built saved, so if you really get stuck, ask for it.

## Golf challenge
-------
This one I feel is slightly easier than the previous, all you have to do is figure out what some golf code does! Also, you will need the number 6. Do not put it in the program, but once you figure out what the program does, you will know how to use it. You will use main.py for this one.
